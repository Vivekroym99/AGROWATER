## Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Implementation Process

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - Parse the feature request
   - Ask clarifying questions if ambiguous
   - Identify affected components and systems

2. **Design**
   - Plan the data model changes (if any)
   - Design component structure
   - Plan API endpoints (if needed)
   - Consider edge cases and error states

3. **Implement Backend First** (if applicable)
   - Database migrations
   - API routes
   - Server-side validation

4. **Implement Frontend**
   - TypeScript interfaces first
   - Create/update components
   - Implement forms with validation
   - Add proper loading and error states

5. **Integration**
   - Connect frontend to backend
   - Test the complete flow
   - Handle edge cases

6. **Polish**
   - Responsive design
   - Accessibility
   - Performance optimization

## Code Standards

- Full TypeScript types (no `any`)
- Zod validation for all forms
- Proper error boundaries
- Loading states for async operations
- Comments only where logic is complex

## Deliverables

- List of files created/modified
- Any required environment variables
- Testing instructions
- Known limitations (if any)
